===== TRANSCRIPT =====
do you know that feeling when you start building something and then uh it just
gets you so excited that you can't go to sleep uh and you just can't stop
thinking about it cuz that's where I am at right now for the last 48 hours I've
been building some voice agents um and man I I think I found what my next
startup is going to be and in this video I'm going to show you what I built I'm
going to show you what I think my next startup is going to be and I'm going to
give you a free boiler plate so you can start building your own um I came
across Isaiah granite's post he had a post where he created this so it's um a
basic app related to Star Trek and then when you click open Channel this is the
USS Enterprise computer Captain Kirk not available can I assist you yeah can
you tell me what uh Captain Kirk is doing capturing query is running level
three Diagnostics on ship's propul all right so after I saw that I was like
holy crap that's so cool if you are not aware Isaiah Granite is the CEO of a
company called Bland AI you may have seen their ads one of their ads went viral
it was this one uh still hiring humans hilar very sad so these guys have built
a phone agent like a voice agent uh it's super fast it works incredibly well
they've gone very in depth um with figuring out all the plumbing and they've
just done a fantastic job so anyways I went on to blend's uh website I went
into the docs uh so I could start exploring how to do what he just did and what
I came across was the fact that they have web agents basically uh a voice agent
that can live on a website which got me thinking wouldn't it be cool to build
in this area because because I do think that the future of uh AI communication
with humans is not going to be via typing it's most likely going to be either
face to face you looking at an avatar or voice to voice so um we all know about
the real-time API with open AI it's expensive I think it's like 15 to 20 bucks
an hour um working with this is significantly cheaper and it has significantly
more control aspects um but instead of talking more about this let me just show
you what I built all right so we have a basic uh nextjs app that you can build
upon what I have over here is I have the ability to have a chat within my
browser so just check this out hey it's Ali from learn to build AI how can I
help you today hey I'm Ali from learn to build AI what are you doing I'm so
sorry I think there's been a mixup I'm actually the one who's supposed to be
Ali from learn to build Ai and all right so you get the gist right I could have
a conversation with it but what if I have a website that I want to implement
this for um so it got me thinking because I do have a situation where I have a
bunch of garbage in the garage that needs to be dealt with so I called this
company they're in Vancouver and I booked the whole meeting they were so fast I
basically put in an inquiry on their website and they called me within 2
minutes I genuinely thought that the girl who called me was AI I even asked her
are you an AI and she's like no but with that being said let's take a look at
what I can do here so in here I'm going to click this button up here enter our
website I'm going to enter that website hit enter and it's going to load while
it's loading I'll tell you exactly what's happening so basically the voice
agent gets initiated then I go ahead and I put on a website uh what happens in
the background it uses a tool called fir crawl and Fir craw goes and Maps the
whole website basically goes and takes every single URL that's associated to
that website then it sends it to GPT um and GPT goes through all of the URLs
and pulls out the relevant ones then it takes all of those relevant URLs and
scrapes each page one by one and then when you scrape all those pages it sends
it back to GPT and it asks it to create a prompt for your agent and what you
end up with is an agent Associated to that website so any website um can now be
turned into a voice agent so it's done loading I'm going to hit refresh and now
you have it you have 505 junk customer service hello welcome to 505 junk how
can I assist you with your junk removal needs today do you service North
Vancouver yes we do service North Vancouver we cover the entire Greater
Vancouver area including North Vancouver what type of junk removal service are
you looking for well I have a couch and I have like maybe three bags worth of
loose junk um do you take that yes so we can definitely take those items for
the couch it's a bulky item and for the bags of loose junk we'll weigh them and
provide you with a quote based on our pricing would you like to schedule a
pickup for today or another day that suits you uh I'm actually comparing your
service with a bunch of others how does your pricing work our pricing is based
on the weight of the items to be removed there is a $99 pickup fee for the
first2 200 and anything over that is charged per pound based on the type of
items so for your couch and the bags of junk I can give you a more accurate
quote once I know the exact weight where tell you that we often provide we're
located in Richmond but we serve the entire Greater Vancouver area including
North Vancouver so what you saw there was I chatted with it and it took 3
minutes for it to scrape the whole website build a prompt and build an AI voice
agent for me for that website think about that think about how easy it is for
this company to just contact me and say hey we want that voice agent on a
contact us page the amount of friction that gets reduced by being able to just
call or have a voice chat right away instead of going through a bunch of
different websites the value here is insane but what if you're like hey I want
to do this but I don't know how to prompt it well I have a button right here
boom it downloads The Prompt for you and there you go here's my prompt I'll
just explain it to you quickly you have the name of the agent you have the role
what their objective is their basically their core personality um their style
of communication some rules that they have to follow and they also have a Q&A
so this Q&A was created by scraping all the the multiple pages on their website
and then ultimately ends up creating a Q&A of common questions that a that a
user will ask um and guys this is just an MVP this could be improved so much
better but this is what we have so far um so now um I'll do a random website
just to show you that this isn't some predetermined demo all right let's go to
um google.com and let's just search um something like Austin Texas roofing
company roofing company uh all right and let's just pick one that's like here
kid Roofing I'm G to copy that let's go back here I'm going to create another
agent oh this one has it wasn't even the full thing it was Austin Roofing so
let's see what it does I know nothing about this company kid roof.com nothing
don't mind me I'm just going to have a chicken wing while that loads so this
must be a really big website cuz this is taking some time so if you go into
your inspect console and you'll see what's actually happening in the background
see using FOC craw here and then we scrape it with Ginia um just because it's
free to scrape it with Ginia but FOC craw has a fantastic mapping tool and it's
uh by far the best and they also have a free tier perfect let's hit refresh all
right there we go kid Roofing assistant generated welcome to kid Roofing how
can I assist you with your Roofing needs today uh hey there where do you
service we service multiple areas in Central Texas including Austin San Antonio
Dallas Houston and we also cover Denver Colorado which area are you calling
from I'm calling from Austin can you tell me more about your services what
makes your company unique kid Roofing has been in business since 1982 holds an
A+ BBB rating and has received numerous awards for our outstanding service and
quality work we offer a wide range of services including roof installation
repair maintenance and emergency repairs we're committed to providing top
quality customer service so can you tell me about your reviews do you have good
reviews bad reviews y we take all feedback seriously and while we strive for
Perfection we've had very few complaints over the years I can assure you that
we do our best to address any concerns and ensure customer satisfaction do you
guys work just on residential no we work on both residential and Commercial
properties including multif family buildings so we can handle a wide range of
roofing needs gotcha where is your main location our main office is located in
Austin Texas at 1212 East Anderson Lane s 200 all right let me just ver I that
12 oh there we go what's the phone number for uh kid Roofing our phone number
is 512 67177 91 say that again it's 512 671 7791 you can also find it on our
website at kid roof.com are you sure the phone number is not 512 931 3988 I
apologize for the mistake let me verify uh yes I made an error our correct
phone number is indeed 512 931 3988 thank thank you for correcting me all right
tell me a little bit more about your company I can tell you that we've been
familyowned and operated for over 40 years gotcha thank you so much you're and
just like that I have a voice agent like I said it's not perfect this is an MVP
it's only using about 10 to 15 pages from their website and that's pretty damn
spot-on minus the fact that it made an error there so with that being said how
do I go fix that I would just download this and then I would take a look at the
data so at the bottom of the data here it should have the phone number now
where the heck heck did it get this phone number so let me just go and check so
it is the accurate phone number so that actually is the right phone number it
seems to be the main business line from their Google that freaking worked cool
so there you have it you have your own voice assistant uh for any company any
website um you can generate a voice assistant like that all right so now let me
show you how to go ahead and download a boiler plate so you could start
building up on your own all right so in the description of this video you're
going to find my Bland boiler plate I just made it public about 3 minutes ago
you want to just click on code copy that go into cursor create a new folder
desktop land D you can name it whatever you want all right go into new terminal
get clone paste that it's going to go ahead and download everything here you're
going to have a readme file where is that readme file read me file all the
instructions are going to be here um but if you're not reading them and you
just want me to tell you that's to cool too so you just go into this file over
here env. local. example and you want to hit rename just take off the example
part then go to Bland go to sign up so sign in go in the bottom left corner
click settings API Keys click new API key copy that to clipboard close go here
put it in there all right you're good to go so far so then what you want to do
is you want to go API key in here you want to go to terminal new terminal you
want to do CD blend boiler plate then CD voice chat MPN run Dev and and there
you go you have a voice agent um this does not have the URL does not have the
scraping capabilities that is in uh something that I'm building it's not ready
for public use yet but it is something I'm building upon anyways let's get this
going yep hello I'm Dave your AI assistant how may I help you today hey Dave
what are you up to today just waiting for someone to pick up the phone so I can
rip them apart with some Savage roasts and that someone is you ah lucky me cool
there you go this is how you do it that's as simple as that if the current
prompt in there is a roasting prompt so the way that you go ahead and get that
is um in the file here one to once you're in here SRC click on config you have
this thing called Agent config and this is where Dave the roast comedian uh
lives and you could change this any way you like and just like that you have
your own voice agent it's built upon nextjs and you might be asking why did I
complicate it and add it as a next JSF is so that you can go ahead and build
your own SAS um as your own voice agent SAS business um which brings me to what
I think my next AI startup is going to be so let's just close this they get the
boiler player if you have any questions just hit me in the comments um awesome
so presenting to you what I think is going to be my next startup because I'm
just having so much fun with this all right so this is what I built using that
boiler plate so you could take the boiler plate you could do whatever you want
with it my next startup is most likely going to be called AI talk team because
I think there's so much potential for this but listen um that same do Dave who
roast people this is him here finally some fresh insecurities to exploit this
is going to be fun hey Dave should I tell you a little bit about myself or what
oh oh please do I'm just salivating at the thought of all the juicy flaws I'm
going to find I've got all day to rip you apart well my name is Ali and I have
a YouTube channel called learn to build I just started it Ali and you think
people actually want to learn from you what makes you an expert on building
anything besides a house of cards that's going to come crashing down the moment
I start roasting you bro you sound like my comment section so you're already
used to being hated on her well that's cute but trust me Ally I'm not some
Anonymous troll hiding behind a screen so there you have it uh now you have
this little interface of what I'm building um but I wanted to add additional
agents to this so this is what I did so we have a doctor a job interview coach
a high performance coach fact Checker um all sorts of different ones so let me
just show you the fact Checker because this one has tools associated with which
is what you can add I am Bobby your dedicated fact Checker I'll help you verify
any information by checking reliable sources what would you like like me to
look up hey Bobby who won the most recent election in the US the last US
presidential election was and who won it according to my sources the last US
presidential election was held on November 2024 and Donald Trump won the
election securing 312 electoral votes and the national popular vote defeating
kamla Harris anything else you'd like to know how much did kamla Harris pay
Oprah let me check if there's any information on that according to my sources
kamla Harris's campaign paid Oprah Winfrey's production company Harpo
Productions $1 million for hosting a town hall event in September 20124 however
it's worth noting that Oprah Winfrey herself has denied receiving a personal
fee for the event okay we have it uh it is currently November 15th so that
information is 10 days old um cool so now we have the ability to use tools and
there are a lot of tools that you could add a custom tools so you could ask it
to email you notify you you could ask it to do anything all right so as we go
forward here I'll show you some of the other agents so we got the doctor agent
the job interview agent um high performance coach uh AI therapist now I think I
could build a startup just around this one over here um because once you start
adding tools here like documentation uh context knowledge and so on just this
becomes incredibly powerful uh we got a philosopher we got a Peter teal like
character who does linking um we got your leftwing activist your right-wing
activist so if you like debating um these are agents that you can chat with for
hours on end and they will hold their ground they'll check their sources and
they will debate you then we have one just for fun which is Riley the woke one
hi there just so you don't shy away from calling out privilege let's make this
conversation an accountable one got you hey Riley who you think of Donald Trump
winning the most recent election content warning discussion of potentially
triggering topic to be honest I think it's a prime example of systemic issues
at play perpetuating harm and amplifying existing inequalities what are your
thoughts on it all right there you go all right so and then you have the
relationship so then there's Sam your best friend Sophia your best friend
female then you got flirting uh assistant so basically Cindy teaches you how to
flirt James flirts with you um then you have Stacy she's a Dirty Talker and
this isn't as censored as I expected it to be I was really surprised of how far
that can go but um if you're interested in building like an AI startup that's
focused on Virtual Boy girlfriends which is a huge Market uh this will be able
to assist you um and then startups that are just focused on tutoring uh this
Alexa tutoring the study partner really good um because what it does is it ends
up it starts with a a set of questions that asks you what are you studying what
is your level what's your level of understanding it goes on to perplexity
follow finds relevant questions and answers and then quizzes you using
memorization Frameworks um so I think what you can do here is unbelievably
Dynamic um and there's so much potential for these voice agents so the ones I'm
most excited about are are AI therapists which I think is wonderful um this job
interview coach just says like yo what's the job that you're looking for what
are your qualifications it goes and scrapes the the job posting and then does a
mock interview with you and encourages you and helps you better understand how
to answer these questions and present yourself better so yeah so much potential
here um now earlier I stated that um with the Bland platform um it's very
different from the open AI realtime API um because it has a couple different
features these guys have really done a good job figuring out the plumbing um so
this is just like an example once you have an agent um you're able to go in and
you you're able to create these conversational Pathways where you can create
Pathways based on what an individual says so for example if you're the study
agent you could start off by asking hey what are you studying uh and then it
goes and pulls that data so there's knowledge bases there's canned answers so
unbelievably Dynamic like this look at this example of somebody creating a
receptionist agent there are so many noes here and this is all on a like on a
no code style you could code it as well which is what I'm doing but a fantastic
platform so many opportunities here and I'm really surprised this isn't uh all
over the place right now um these voice agents specifically the one that's
going to end up um living on the contact page for for businesses is the one
that I'm most excited about uh every company that does Services should have a
voice agent that books meetings directly on the website answers questions so
you just don't lose any leads um so yeah that's the video for today um I hope
you enjoy that if if you love learning how to build with AI um hit that
subscribe button because there's no other YouTuber there's no other person on
this on this platform who's willing to show you what they're building give you
the code so you could compete with them and show you a bunch of potential
things that you could do with it hit the like button hit the Subscribe button
um and leave a comment leave just any comment tell me what you guys want me to
talk about if there's anything that you saw here you want me to dig deeper into
uh the relationship um agents the uh AI agents just let me know I think you
guys are going to love my next video which is going to be focused more on how
to build the UI for your own web apps all right peace talk to you soon         ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
